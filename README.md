# What this project is all about?
This is a basic React app which can help you in your day to day life by performing some simple edits in your text.
This web app can:
1. Convert all your written text to uppercase with the click of just a button.
2. Convert all your written text to lowercase with the click of just a button.
3. Can remove all the extra whitespaces in your text.
4. You can copy all the edited text by just clikcing the copy to clipboard button.
5. Count and display number of words and characters inside your text.

# Motivation
This is my first React app. I got the motivation to build this app by just my own experience of visiting a similar website which can perform the word count of the entered text and so I decided to build such an app myself.

# What does this project taught?
This project helps me getting a grasp on the basic concepts of react like state handling and fuction based components and how to perform routing inside react and other concepts and also helps in brushing up some basic javascript.
